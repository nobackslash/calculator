## Known issues ðŸ”§
- If done any calculation, if you type any numbers, it is going to continue the same last expression.
- Can't treat double operator sign inputs.
- Can't use negative numbers as the program assumes the first character will always be a number.

### Versioning
I still don't know how to use versioning. I know this is a small and simple project, but I think versioning would be useful as a learning method and better organization on the changelog .md (which doesn't exists yet)
